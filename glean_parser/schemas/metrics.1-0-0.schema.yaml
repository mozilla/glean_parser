  Schema for the metrics.yaml files for Mozilla's Glean telemetry SDK.

  The top-level of the `metrics.yaml` file has a key defining each category of
  metrics. Categories must be snake_case, and they may also have dots `.` to
  define subcategories.

    properties:
      type:
        title: Metric type
        description: |
          **Required.**

          Specifies the type of a metric, like "counter" or "event". This defines
          which operations are valid for the metric, how it is stored and how
          data analysis tooling displays it.

          The supported types are:
            - `event`: Record a specific event (with optional metadata).
              Additional properties: `extra_keys`.

            - `boolean`: A metric storing values of true or false.

            - `string`: A metric storing Unicode string values.

            - `string_list`: a list of Unicode strings.

            - `enumeration`: a string with a fixed set of values. Additional properties:
              `values`_.

            - `counter`: A numeric value that can only be incremented.

            - `quantity`: A numeric value that is set directly. Only allowed for metrics
              coming from GeckoView.

            - `timespan`: Represents a time interval. Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `timing_distribution`: Record the distribution of multiple timings.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `datetime`: A date/time value.  Represented as an ISO datetime in UTC.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `use_counter`: Records the value of one of more values in relation
              to another value. Represented internally as a list of numerators
              and denominator, all of which can be incremented separately.
              Additional properties: `labels`_, `denominator`_.

            - `usage`: Record whether a feature is used. This is functionally
              equivalent to a boolean metric type, except the analysis and
              visualization side may present it differently, knowing that it
              indicates the usage of a feature.

            - `rate`: Record the rate of an event over time. This is functionally
              equivalent to a counter, except the analysis and visualization
              will tie it to the duration of the ping to display it as a rate
              over time.

            - `uuid`: Record a UUID v4.

            - `memory_distribution`: A histogram for recording memory usage values.
              Additional properties: `memory_unit`_.

            - `custom_distribution`: A histogram with a custom range and number of buckets.
              This metric type is for legacy support only and is only allowed for
              metrics coming from GeckoView.
              Additional properties: `range_min`_, `range_max`_, `bucket_count`_, `histogram_type`_.

            - Additionally, labeled versions of many metric types are
              supported.  These support the `labels`_ parameter, allowing multiple
              instances of the metric to be stored at a given set of labels.  The
              labeled metric types include:

                `labeled_boolean`, `labeled_string`,
                `labeled_enumeration`, `labeled_counter`,
                `labeled_timing_distribution`, `labeled_datetime`,
                `labeled_use_counter`, `labeled_usage`, `labeled_rate`.
        type: string
        enum:
          - event
          - boolean
          - string
          - string_list

      description:
        title: Description
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A textual description of what this metric does, what it means, and its
          edge cases or any other helpful information.
        type: string

      lifetime:
        title: Lifetime
        description: |
          Defines the lifetime of the metric.  It must be one of the following values:

          - `ping` (default): The metric is reset each time it is sent in a ping.

          - `user`: The metric contains a property that is part of the user's
            profile and is never reset.

          - `application`: The metric contains a property that is related to the
            application, and is reset only at application restarts.
        enum:
          - ping
          - user
          - application
        default: ping

      send_in_pings:
        title: Send in pings
        description: |
          Which pings the metric should be sent on. If not specified, the metric
          is sent on the "default ping", which is the `events` ping for events,
          and the `metrics` ping for everything else. Most metrics don't need to
          specify this.

          (There is an additional special value of `all_pings` for internal
          Glean metrics only that is used to indicate that a metric may appear
          in any ping.)
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: "#/definitions/snake_case"

        items:
          type: string
          format: email

      bugs:
        title: Related bugs
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of bugs (e.g. Bugzilla and Github) that are relevant to this
          metric, e.g., tracking its original implementation or later changes to
          it.

          If a number, it is an ID to an issue in the default tracker (e.g.
          Mozilla's Bugzilla instance). If a string, it must be a URI to a bug
          page in a tracker.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          anyOf:

          If `true`, the metric is disabled, and any metric collection on it will
          be silently ignored at runtime.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      expires:
        title: Expires
        description: |
          **Required.**

          May be one of the following values:
            - `<build date>`: An ISO date `yyyy-mm-dd` in UTC on which the
              metric expires. For example, `2019-03-13`. This date is checked at
              build time. Except in special cases, this form should be used so
              that the metric automatically "sunsets" after a period of time.
            - `never`: This metric never expires.
            - `expired`: This metric is manually expired.
        type: string
        pattern: "(never)|(expired)|([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})"

      version:
        title: Metric version
        description: |
          The version of the metric. A monotonically increasing value. If not
          provided, defaults to 0.

      values:
        title: Supported values
        description: |
          A list of the supported enumeration values.

          Valid when `type`_ is `enumeration`.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string

      time_unit:
        title: Time unit
        description: |
          Specifies the unit that the metric will be stored and displayed in. If
          not provided, it defaults to milliseconds. Time values are sent to the
          backend as integers, so `time_unit`_ determines the maximum
          resolution at which timespans are recorded. Times are always truncated,
          not rounded, to the nearest time unit. For example, a measurement of 25 ns
          will be returned as 0 ms if `time_unit` is `"millisecond"`.

          Valid when `type`_ is `timespan`, `timing_distribution` or `datetime`.
        enum:
          - nanosecond
          - microsecond
          - millisecond

          - day

      memory_unit:
        title: Memory unit
        description: |
          The unit that the incoming memory size values are recorded in.

          The units are the power-of-2 units, so "kilobyte" is correctly a "kibibyte".

          - kilobyte == 2^10 ==         1,024 bytes
          - megabyte == 2^20 ==     1,048,576 bytes
          - gigabyte == 2^30 == 1,073,741,824 bytes

          Values are automatically converted to and transmitted as bytes.

          Valid when `type`_ is `memory_distribution`.
        enum:
          - byte
          - kilobyte
          - megabyte
          - gigabyte

      labels:
        title: Labels
        description: |
          A list of labels for a labeled metric.  If provided, the labels are
          enforced at run time, and recording to an unknown label is recorded
          to the special label ``__other__``.  If not provided, the labels
          may be anything, but using too many unique labels will put some
          labels in the special label ``__other__``.

          Valid with any of the labeled metric types.
        anyOf:

      denominator:
        title: Denominator
        description: |
          The name of the denominator value for a use counter.

          Valid when `type`_ is `use_counter`.
        allOf:

      extra_keys:
        title: Extra keys
        description: |
          The acceptable keys on the "extra" object sent with events. This is an
          object mapping the key to an object containing metadata about the key.
          This metadata object has the following keys:

      gecko_datapoint:
        title: Gecko Datapoint
        description: |
          This is a Gecko-specific property. It is the name of the Gecko histogram to
          accumulate the data from, when using the Glean SDK in a product using GeckoView.

        title: Histogram type
        description: |
          The type of histogram bucketing to use:
            - `linear`: The buckets are linearly spaced within the range.
            - `exponential`: The buckets use the natural logarithmic so the smaller-valued
              buckets are smaller in size than the higher-valued buckets.

          Required when `type`_ is `custom_distribution`.
        enum:
