  Schema for the metrics.yaml files for Mozilla's Glean telemetry SDK.

  The top-level of the `metrics.yaml` file has a key defining each category of
  metrics. Categories must be snake_case, and they may also have dots `.` to
  define subcategories.

    properties:
      type:
        title: Metric type
        description: |
          **Required.**

          Specifies the type of a metric, like "counter" or "event". This defines
          which operations are valid for the metric, how it is stored and how
          data analysis tooling displays it.

          The supported types are:
            - `event`: Record a specific event (with optional metadata).
              Additional properties: `extra_keys`.

            - `boolean`: A metric storing values of true or false.

            - `string`: A metric storing Unicode string values.

            - `string_list`: a list of Unicode strings.

            - `enumeration`: a string with a fixed set of values. Additional properties:
              `values`_.

            - `counter`: A numeric value that can only be incremented.

            - `timespan`: Represents a time interval. Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `timing_distribution`: Record the distribution of multiple timings.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `datetime`: A date/time value.  Represented as an ISO datetime in UTC.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`_.

            - `use_counter`: Records the value of one of more values in relation
              to another value. Represented internally as a list of numerators
              and denominator, all of which can be incremented separately.
              Additional properties: `labels`_, `denominator`_.

            - `usage`: Record whether a feature is used. This is functionally
              equivalent to a boolean metric type, except the analysis and
              visualization side may present it differently, knowing that it
              indicates the usage of a feature.

            - `rate`: Record the rate of an event over time. This is functionally
              equivalent to a counter, except the analysis and visualization
              will tie it to the duration of the ping to display it as a rate
              over time.

            - `uuid`: Record a UUID v4.

            - Additionally, labeled versions of many metric types are
              supported.  These support the `labels`_ parameter, allowing multiple
              instances of the metric to be stored at a given set of labels.  The
              labeled metric types include:

                `labeled_boolean`, `labeled_string`, `labeled_string_list`,
                `labeled_enumeration`, `labeled_counter`, `labeled_timespan`,
                `labeled_timing_distribution`, `labeled_datetime`,
                `labeled_use_counter`, `labeled_usage`, `labeled_rate`,
                `labeled_uuid`.
        type: string
        enum:
          - event
          - boolean
          - string
          - string_list
          - enumeration
          - counter
          - timespan
          - timing_distribution
          - datetime
          - use_counter
          - usage
          - rate
          - uuid
          - labeled_boolean
          - labeled_string
          - labeled_string_list
          - labeled_enumeration
          - labeled_counter
          - labeled_timespan
          - labeled_timing_distribution
          - labeled_datetime
          - labeled_use_counter
          - labeled_usage
          - labeled_rate

      description:
        title: Description
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A textual description of what this metric does, what it means, and its
          edge cases or any other helpful information.
        type: string

      lifetime:
        title: Lifetime
        description: |
          Defines the lifetime of the metric.  It must be one of the following values:

          - `ping` (default): The metric is reset each time it is sent in a ping.

          - `user`: The metric contains a property that is part of the user's
            profile and is never reset.

          - `application`: The metric contains a property that is related to the
            application, and is reset only at application restarts.
        enum:
          - ping
          - user
          - application
        default: ping

      send_in_pings:
        title: Send in pings
        description: |
          Which pings the metric should be sent on. If not specified, the metric
          is sent on the "default ping", which is the `events` ping for events,
          and the `metrics` ping for everything else. Most metrics don't need to
          specify this.
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: "#/definitions/snake_case"
        default:

      notification_emails:
        title: Notification emails
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of email addresses to notify for important events with the
          metric or when people with context or ownership for the metric need to
          be contacted.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          type: string
          format: email

      bugs:
        title: Related bugs
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of bugs (e.g. Bugzilla and Github) that are relevant to this
          metric, e.g., tracking its original implementation or later changes to
          it.

          If a number, it is an ID to an issue in the default tracker (e.g.
          Mozilla's Bugzilla instance). If a string, it must be a URI to a bug
          page in a tracker.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          anyOf:
            - type: integer
            - type: string
              format: uri

      data_reviews:
        title: Review references
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of URIs to any data collection reviews relevant to the metric.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          format: uri

      disabled:
        title: Disabled
        description: |
          If `true`, the metric is disabled, and any metric collection on it will
          be silently ignored at runtime.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      expires:
        title: Expires
        description: |
          **Required.**

          May be one of the following values:
            - `<build date>`: An ISO date `yyyy-mm-dd` in UTC on which the
              metric expires. For example, `2019-03-13`. This date is checked at
              build time. Except in special cases, this form should be used so
              that the metric automatically "sunsets" after a period of time.
            - `never`: This metric never expires.
            - `expired`: This metric is manually expired.
        type: string
        pattern: "(never)|(expired)|([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})"

      version:
        title: Metric version
        description: |
          The version of the metric. A monotonically increasing value. If not
          provided, defaults to 0.

      values:
        title: Supported values
        description: |
          A list of the supported enumeration values.

          Valid when `type`_ is `enumeration`.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string

      time_unit:
        title: Time unit
        description: |
          Specifies the unit that the metric will be stored and displayed in. If
          not provided, it defaults to milliseconds. Time values are sent to the
          backend as integers, so `time_unit`_ determines the maximum
          resolution at which timespans are recorded. Times are always truncated,
          not rounded, to the nearest time unit. For example, a measurement of 25 ns
          will be returned as 0 ms if `time_unit` is `"millisecond"`.

          Valid when `type`_ is `timespan`, `timing_distribution` or `datetime`.
        enum:
          - nanosecond
          - microsecond
          - millisecond
          - second
          - minute
          - hour
          - day

      labels:
        title: Labels
        description: |
          A list of labels for a labeled metric.  If provided, the labels are
          enforced at run time, and recording to an unknown label is recorded
          to the special label ``__other__``.  If not provided, the labels
          may be anything, but using too many unique labels will put some
          labels in the special label ``__other__``.

          Valid with any of the labeled metric types.
        anyOf:
          - type: array
            items:
              $ref: "#/definitions/long_id"

      denominator:
        title: Denominator
        description: |
          The name of the denominator value for a use counter.

          Valid when `type`_ is `use_counter`.
