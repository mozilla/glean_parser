    properties:
      type:
        title: Metric type
        description: |
          Specifies the type of a metric, like "counter" or "event". This defines
          which operations are valid for the metric, how it is stored and how
          data analysis tooling displays it.

          The supported types are:
            - boolean: true or false.
            - string: a Unicode string value. Additional properties: `max_length`.
            - string_list: a list of Unicode strings. Additional properties:
              `max_length`, `max_entries`.
            - enumeration: a string with a fixes set of values. Additional properties:
              `values`.
            - counter: A numeric value that can only be incremented.
            - timespan: Represents a time interval. Additional properties: `time_unit`.
            - timing_distribution: Record the distribution of multiple timings.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`.
            - datetime: A date/time value.  Represented as an ISO datetime in UTC.
              Additional properties: `time_unit`.
            - use_counter: Records the value of one of more values in relation
              to another value. Represented internally as a list of numerators
              and denominator, all of which can be incremented separately.
              Additional properties: `labels`, `denominator`.
            - usage: Record whether a feature is used. This is functionally
              equivalent to a boolean metric type, except the analysis and
              visualization side may present it differently, knowing that it
              indicates the usage of a feature.
            - rate: Record the rate of an event over time. This is functionally
              equivalent to a counter, except the analysis and visualization
              will tie it to the duration of the ping to display it as a rate
              over time.
            - event: Record a specific event (with optional metadata).
              Additional properties: `objects` and `extra_keys`.
        type: string
        enum:
          - boolean
          - string
          - string_list
          - enumeration
          - counter
          - timespan
          - timing_distribution
          - datetime
          - use_counter
          - usage
          - rate
          - event

        title: Description
        description: |
          A textual description of what this metric does, means, its edge cases
          and any other helpful information.
        type: string

      user_property:
        title: User property
        description: |
          If true, the metric contains a property that is part of the user's
          profile and is never reset. Only one of `user_property` or
          `application_property` may be `true`.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      application_property:
        title: Application property
        description: |
          If true, the metric contains a property that is related to the
          application, and is reset only at application restarts. Only one of
          `user_property` or `application_property` may be `true`.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      send_in_pings:
        title: Send in pings
        description: |
          Which pings the metric should be sent on. If not specified, the metric
          is sent on the "default ping", which is the "events" ping for events,
          and the "metrics" ping for everything else. Most metrics don't need to
          specify this.

          it. If a number, it is an ID to an issue in the default tracker (e.g.
          Mozilla's Bugzilla instance). If a string, it must be a URI to a bug
          page in a tracker.
        type: array

          be silently ignored at runtime.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      expires_after_build_date:
        title: Expires after build date.
        description: |

          collection using the metric should be silently ignored. The date is
          checked at build time. If the specified date is passed, this metric is
          seen as expired.
        anyOf:
          - type: string
            format: date-time
          - type: "null"

      time_unit:
        title: Time unit
        description: |
          Specifies the unit that the metric will be stored and displayed in. If
          not provided, it defaults to milliseconds. Time values are sent to the
          backend as integers, so `time_unit` also implies the maximum
